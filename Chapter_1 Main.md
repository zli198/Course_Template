# Deep Neural Networks

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a fundamental component of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning. These computational models are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain.

## What are Deep Neural Networks?

A deep neural network consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transform input data to produce meaningful outputs. The "deep" aspect refers to having multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers, typically three or more.

## Key Components

- **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and extract features from the data
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that the network learns during training
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity to enable complex pattern recognition

## Applications

Deep neural networks have revolutionized many fields including:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles
- Game playing (like AlphaGo)

## Why Deep Learning Works

The power of deep networks lies in their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, extracting simple features in early layers and combining them to recognize complex patterns in deeper layers.
